```

The system follows a **semantic segmentation pipeline** optimized for geospatial computer vision:

1. **Input Processing:** Satellite images are normalized and augmented using Albumentations, which provides GPU-accelerated transformations specifically designed for image segmentation tasks.

2. **Model Architecture:** DeepLabV3+ serves as the backbone, chosen for its exceptional performance in dense prediction tasks. The encoder (ResNet-34 by default, configurable to EfficientNet-B4) extracts hierarchical features, while the ASPP module captures multi-scale context through parallel dilated convolutions.

3. **Training Strategy:** The model is trained using Binary Cross-Entropy with Logits loss, optimized via Adam with weight decay for regularization. A ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler dynamically adjusts the learning rate based on validation Dice score, preventing overfitting while maintaining convergence speed.

4. **Evaluation & Deployment:** Comprehensive metrics (Dice coefficient, IoU, Precision, Recall, F1) ensure robust performance assessment. The trained model can be deployed via CLI for batch processing or through a Streamlit web interface for interactive use.

### Core Algorithms & Logic

**Semantic Segmentation with DeepLabV3+**

The core of this system is a **DeepLabV3+ architecture** implemented using `segmentation-models-pytorch`. This architecture was specifically chosen for several critical reasons:

- **Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP):** Unlike traditional CNNs that lose spatial resolution through pooling, DeepLabV3+ employs dilated convolutions in the ASPP module to maintain resolution while expanding the receptive field. This is crucial for road detection, where roads can vary from narrow residential streets (few pixels wide) to major highways (hundreds of pixels wide).

- **Encoder-Decoder Structure:** The encoder (ResNet-34/EfficientNet-B4 pretrained on ImageNet) extracts robust feature representations, while the decoder progressively upsamples and refines predictions. The low-level features from the encoder are concatenated with decoder features, recovering fine spatial details critical for precise road boundary delineation.

- **Transfer Learning Strategy:** By leveraging ImageNet-pretrained encoders, the model starts with learned feature extractors that already understand edges, textures, and shapes‚Äîuniversal patterns applicable to satellite imagery. This significantly reduces training time and improves performance, especially with limited training data.

**Data Augmentation Pipeline**

The augmentation strategy is engineered to simulate real-world variations in satellite imagery:

```python
# From src/data_loader.py
A.Compose([
    A.Resize(512, 512),
    A.HorizontalFlip(p=0.5),          # Geographic invariance
    A.VerticalFlip(p=0.5),            # Geographic invariance
    A.RandomBrightnessContrast(p=0.2), # Lighting conditions
    A.Rotate(limit=15, p=0.3),        # Orientation variation
    A.Normalize(),
    ToTensorV2(),
])
```

This pipeline ensures the model generalizes across different:
- Geographic orientations (flips and rotations)
- Lighting conditions and weather (brightness/contrast adjustments)
- Image resolutions (resize with aspect ratio preservation)

**Multi-Metric Evaluation Framework**

The evaluation system employs five complementary metrics to assess different aspects of model performance:

- **Dice Coefficient:** Measures overlap between predicted and ground truth masks, prioritizing overall segmentation quality (harmonic mean of precision and recall).
- **IoU (Jaccard Index):** Stricter than Dice, penalizes both false positives and false negatives, essential for applications requiring precise boundary detection.
- **Precision:** Quantifies the accuracy of predicted road pixels‚Äîcritical when false positives are costly (e.g., routing applications).
- **Recall:** Measures the model's ability to detect all road pixels‚Äîcrucial for ensuring complete network coverage.
- **F1 Score:** Balanced metric considering both precision and recall, useful for comparing models holistically.

## üíª Code Snippet Showcase

The following snippet from `src/train.py` demonstrates the **training loop with sophisticated metric tracking and checkpointing logic**. This design pattern ensures training can be resumed from any point, implements early stopping to prevent overfitting, and tracks multiple metrics simultaneously for comprehensive model evaluation.

```python
# Core training loop with early stopping and multi-metric validation
for epoch in range(start_epoch, config['train']['epochs']):
    model.train()
    epoch_loss = 0.0
    loop = tqdm(train_loader, desc=f"Epoch [{epoch+1}/{config['train']['epochs']}]")

    for images, masks in loop:
        images, masks = images.to(device), masks.to(device)
        
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(images)
        loss = criterion(outputs, masks)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        
        epoch_loss += loss.item()
        loop.set_postfix(loss=loss.item())

    # Validation with comprehensive metrics
    val_metrics = evaluate_model(model, val_loader, device)
    scheduler.step(val_metrics['dice'])  # LR reduction on plateau

    # Save best model based on Dice score
    if val_metrics['dice'] > best_metrics['dice']:
        best_metrics = val_metrics
        save_checkpoint(model, optimizer, epoch, best_metrics, config, best=True)
        patience_counter = 0
    else:
        patience_counter += 1

    # Early stopping to prevent overfitting
    if patience_counter >= max_patience:
        print(f"üõë Early stopping triggered. Best Dice: {best_metrics['dice']:.4f}")
        break
```

**Why this approach?**

1. **Resilience:** Checkpointing both "last" and "best" models ensures training can resume after interruptions and preserves the optimal weights even if training continues past the best epoch.

2. **Efficiency:** Early stopping halts training when validation metrics stop improving, saving computational resources and preventing overfitting.

3. **Observability:** Progress bars with real-time loss updates and comprehensive metric logging (Dice, IoU, Precision, Recall, F1) provide full transparency into model behavior.

4. **Adaptive Learning:** The ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler automatically reduces the learning rate when Dice score plateaus, enabling the model to fine-tune and escape local minima.
